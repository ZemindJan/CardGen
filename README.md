# How to get the cards
Run fetch_sheet.py to download latest data
Run process_data.py to process downloaded data into cards
The cards will be in the out directory

# Icons
Icons are stored in assets/icons and their filepaths are stored in a dictionary in text/icons.py
They are referenced with a # in front of their name. #dmg loads assets/icons/dmg.png for example.
